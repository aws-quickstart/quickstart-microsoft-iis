As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow 
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
* In the private subnets:
** Auto-Scaling Group of EC2 Instances.
// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Make sure that the additional components are also represented in the architecture diagram. End each bullet with a period.
* AWS Systems Manager Automation Documents.
* EventBridge Rules.
* IAM Roles.
* Security Groups.

[.small]#*The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
