image::../images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture,width=100%,height=100%]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow 
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
** A Remote Desktop Gateways (RDGW) in an Auto Scaling group
* In the private subnets:
** Auto-Scaling Group of EC2 instances.
** AWS-managed Microsoft Active Directory (AD).
// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Make sure that the additional components are also represented in the architecture diagram. End each bullet with a period.
* AWS Systems Manager to store automation documents.
* Amazon EventBridge, providing the rules that trigger configuration setup or removal in response to scale up or scale down events, respectively.
* IAM Roles.
* Security Groups.
* Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket for storing Managed Object Format (MOP) files.

*The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.
