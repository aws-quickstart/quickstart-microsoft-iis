// Adapt the following warning to your Quick Start.
WARNING: This Quick Start does not support https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-sharing.html[shared subnets^]. If you deploy {partner-product-short-name} into an existing VPC, ensure that the VPC has two private subnets in different Availability Zones for the workload instances, and that the subnets aren’t shared. These subnets require https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html[NAT gateways^] in their route tables, to allow the instances to download packages and software without exposing them to the internet. Also, ensure that the domain name in the DHCP options is configured according to http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html[DHCP options sets^]. Provide your VPC settings when you launch the Quick Start.

[start=2]
. The AWS Region displayed in the upper-right corner of the navigation bar is where the {partner-product-short-name} network infrastructure is deployed in the N. Virginia ({default_deployment_region}) Region by default. Change it if necessary. 

// *Note:* This deployment includes Amazon EFS, which isn’t currently supported in all AWS Regions. For a current list of supported Regions, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/elasticfilesystem.html[endpoints and quotas webpage].

[start=3]
. On the *Create stack* page, keep the default setting for the template URL, and then choose *Next*.
