This Quick Start deployment guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying a Windows Server workload in an Auto Scaling group on the AWS Cloud. It uses http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/[AWS CloudFormation] templates and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/automation-documents.html[AWS Systems Manager Automation documents] to automate the deployment. This Quick Start deploys Internet Information Services (IIS), but it can be modified to deploy any Windows workload. 

This Quick Start is for IT infrastructure architects, administrators, and DevOps professionals who want to implement or extend their Windows Server workloads on AWS.
