==== Prepare your AWS account

This Quick Start assumes that if you choose to deploy IIS into an existing VPC:

* You have an existing Active Directory domain within the VPC. 
* The Domain Name System (DNS) is configured to allow discovery of the Active Directory domain.

NOTE: For reference see the https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/active-directory-ds/Active[Active Directory Domain Services on AWS] Quick Start.
