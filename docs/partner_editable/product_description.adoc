This Quick Start deploys a highly available environment that includes Windows Server and IIS Server running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), using Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling. This infrastructure provides the underpinnings for many Microsoft enterprise solutions, including SharePoint and .NET Framework. Also, the Quick Start demonstrates how to join instances to a domain and remove them from a domain as part of an Auto Scaling group. 

The automation in this deployment uses AWS Systems Manager Automation, AWS CloudFormation, and Windows PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) to deploy IIS into an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group. Configuration of the instances is performed using https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/lifecycle-hooks.html[lifecycle hooks], https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-eventbridge.html[Amazon EventBridge], and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-automation.html[AWS Systems Manager Automation]. 

Implementing IIS in the AWS Cloud is very similar to deploying it in an on-premises setting. However, you must deploy the nodes inside a virtual private cloud (VPC). Plus, it is recommended that you deploy the nodes in separate subnets to provide high availability across multiple Availability Zones.

PowerShell scripts are provided in the \scripts folder, but all Managed Object Format (MOP) files are generated and uploaded to an S3 bucket.
