This Quick Start deploys Microsoft IIS into an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Auto Scaling group. Nodes are deployed into separate subnets across multiple Availability Zones for high availability. As a reference deployment, it demonstrates how to join and remove instances to and from a domain as part of an Auto Scaling group. The infrastructure it deploys provides a foundation for running many Microsoft enterprise solutions on the AWS Cloud, including SharePoint and .NET Framework.

The automation in this Quick Start is provided by AWS Systems Manager, AWS CloudFormation, and Windows PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC).

EC2 instances are configured using https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/lifecycle-hooks.html[lifecycle hooks], https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-eventbridge.html[Amazon EventBridge], and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-automation.html[AWS Systems Manager Automation]. 

PowerShell scripts are provided in the `/scripts` folder, but all Managed Object Format (MOP) files are generated and uploaded to an S3 bucket.
