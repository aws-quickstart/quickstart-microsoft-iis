[link=images/architecture_diagram.png]
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture,width=100%,height=100%]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** Elastic Load Balancers to distribute traffic across EC2 instances.
** Remote Desktop (RD) gateways in an Auto Scaling group.
* In the private subnets:
** Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances into which Microsoft IIS is deployed.
** AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory.
// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Make sure that the additional components are also represented in the architecture diagram. End each bullet with a period.
* Amazon EventBridge, providing the rules that trigger automation routines in response to Auto Scaling events.
* AWS Systems Manager to store automation documents.
* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles.
* Security groups to control traffic to your EC2 instances.
* Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket for storing MOP files.
